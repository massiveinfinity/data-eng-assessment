# Data Engineer Assessment
---
### Objective
Using the sample dataset, you are required to present and apply based on your understanding on data lifecycling:
1. Data Collection
2. ETL
3. Data Storage
4. Data Categorization
5. Data Visualization

### Case Study
Your City Mayor has contacted you to build a dashboard that analyzes the general data of the city.

### Guidelines
1. You can use any form of data storage (mysql, sqlite, postgresql, mongodb, etc), either offline, on-premise or cloud-based.
2. You can use any programming language of your choice for the data operations, and present your data visualization on a simple HTML dashboard (no login module needed) with suitable visualization tool. Dashboard design is not graded, minimally to be presentable for grading of data visualization.
3. Your data import should be done via code and show clearly your data cleaning considerations.
4. Start off with `population.csv`, your data has to be built upon district & neighborhood columns.

### Data Visualization Objectives
1. Year 2017 Metrics
- On overall, show population breakdown % by districts, unemployment % by districts, and accident breakdown % by district, immigrant breakdown by nationality.
- Based on district, plot data visualization metrics to show population, births, deaths, unemployment, immigrants vs emigrants
2. Plot a visualization on life expectancy over time of each districts in comparison
3. Plot visualizations on accident distribution by month, accident distribution by day.
4. Plot a Google Map visualization to show the bus stops in the city.

### Submission
1. Provide necessary information for us to access your code (eg. Github) and database (eg. db access credential). Instructions on environment setup prior to running of application should be included as well.
2. Submission deadline is included in the email.
